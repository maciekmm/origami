\subsection{Problem characteristics}
Origami has been around for a long time. It originated in China and Japan, roughly at the same time, from where it 
spread all around the world\cite{wiki:history-of-origami}. 
Origami is recognized as the art of paper folding.
Although known for centuries, it exhibits properties that are applicable 
in many different contemporary contexts, e.g.
space exploration\cite{origami-in-orbit}, or deploying solar arrays\cite{solar-panel-origami}.
Accordingly, it has recently started attracting attention among scientists and engineers.
Researchers started recognizing material folding as a distinct
branch of mathematics, known as \hyperref[dictionary:computational-origami]{\textit{computational origami}}.
The field has seen tremendous development in the past couple of decades.
Being a broad topic, there are numerous open problems \cite{mit-open-problems} and on-going research.

\medskip

Beginners fold origami by following step-by-step instructions.
More advanced origamists use \hyperref[dictionary:crease-pattern]{\textit{crease patterns}}
to form \hyperref[dictionary:folded-state]{\textit{folded states}}.
The process of origami creation consists of two stages: \textit{design} and \textit{folding}.

\subsection{Motivation}

Even though origami seems to be a child's play, at times
people would get discouraged whilst following the origami instructions due to
the lack of details they expose.

We would like to provide a way, for beginners and advanced origamists alike, to visualize step-by-step a folding process of origami guides.
While there exist some programs aiding the process of design \cite{app:treemaker} \cite{app:omto} \cite{app:origami-draw}, there is no satisfactory application 
that would present the process of folding as it would be carried out manually.

We have evaluated existing solutions, and the one that resembles 
what we would like to achieve the most \cite{origami-simulator} provides a way to load a crease pattern
and display the process of folding. However, it does visualize the process step-by-step, it only allows 
to go from a flat sheet of paper to a folded state immediately. It also bypasses some physical properties, such as the fact that the
paper should collide with itself.

\subsection{Product Vision}

\subsubsection{Functionality}

Our main goal is to create a platform to visualize an origami model in 3D,
in every step of the folding process, while animating transitions between steps.

The inseparable component of the system would be a file format describing the folding sequence necessary to complete the origami figure.\\

\noindent \textbf{The users would be able to:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item load a folding instruction;
	\item choose from the instruction a step they want visualized;
	\item rotate the scene;
    \item zoom in and out;
	\item move around the scene;
	\item pause the animation at any time, and move back and forth.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technology}

Our application will consist of two layers -- backend and frontend.

The backend part will be responsible for storing user files and turning instructions into animated guides.
The frontend part will handle user interactions, 3D visualizations, and communication with the backend.

We have decided to use well-known and battle-tested technologies.
For the backend part we are going to use the \tech{Python} language with \tech{Django} and the \tech{Celery} task queue. To store data we are going to incorporate \tech{PostgreSQL} in our environment..

For the frontend, we will use \tech{JavaScript} with \tech{React} for building the user interface.
The 3D rendering will be performed using \tech{Three.js} library that is built on top of \tech{WebGL} renderer.

		\includegraphics[width=.15\textwidth]{assets/django-logo.png}
	};
	\node[below = of backend] (frontend) [draw,thick,minimum width=4cm, label=north west:Frontend] {
		\includegraphics[width=.12\textwidth]{assets/javascript-logo.png}
		\includegraphics[width=.12\textwidth]{assets/react-logo.png}
		\includegraphics[width=.23\textwidth]{assets/three-js-logo.png}
	};
	\draw[<->,thick] (backend.south) -- (frontend.north);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Feasibility Study}

Both \tech{Python} and \tech{JavaScript} are widely spread and actively maintained.
There is a strong community surrounding both of them.
\tech{Three.js} is the most popular library for 3D \tech{WebGL} rendering.

Therefore, we are not expecting problems connected with the tools we have selected.

Since the project will require a lot of knowledge from the computational origami
field, we will have to research the existing materials on this topic.
The most promising resource seems to be an MIT course by
Eric Demaine \cite{mit-course}, and a book co-authored by the same person -- \textit{Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, Polyhedra} \cite{origami-book}.
Various papers are also available which might come in handy, especially those regarding origami folding software implementations.


\subsection{Threat Assessment}

Playing with the intersection between reality and computer science has always
been a challenging task.
In this project we are trying to tackle a problem that has not yet been discussed.
Every year the field of \textit{computational origami} grows. The mathematics behind it are also not yet well developed.
We foresee many challenges along the way, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item NP-hardness - some problems that we will face are proved to be NP-hard.
		Computing layer ordering based on a crease pattern is an example of such a problem.
		We will have to overcome them, either by using approximate methods or coming up with solutions that will avoid them.

	\item Physical properties of paper - should we support more complex physical properties,
		there are many features that would require a separate set of computations simulating paper physics, e.g.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item inflating,
			\item curving,
			\item cutting.
		\end{itemize}

	\item Performance -- web browsers are still not fully optimized to carry out 3D computations and render 3D graphics in real time.
		The system will have to be highly optimized in order to be usable.
		State of the art programs offload computational payload to GPUs.

	\item Mathematics -- we have little experience in writing complex simulations utilizing complicated mathematical formulas.
		Even modelling a simple paper fold requires computations such as calculating the strain present in different areas of the sheet.

	\item 3D graphics -- we have some experience working with 3D, however only from the user perspective.
		We have little experience in creating 3D graphical software.

\end{itemize}

Having said that, we believe we are capable to undertake this problem and provide a solution to it.
Albeit challenging it is rewarding, especially in terms of projected business value and gained expertise.
