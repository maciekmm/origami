	\item[computational origami] \label{dictionary:computational-origami} - a field of mathematics concerned about algorithms connected with origami folding.
	\item[crease] - a line segment on a paper.
	\item[crease pattern] \label{dictionary:crease-pattern} - a pattern of lines formed by creases that is created after unfolding the origami flat.
	\item[folded state] \label{dictionary:folded-state} - a sheet of paper folded along the crease pattern, an assembled origami model.
	\item[mountain] - a fold of paper along the crease, such that the facets on the sides of the crease are facing downwards.
