abstract = "In Refs. [1], [2], an effective implicit time integration scheme was proposed for the finite element solution of nonlinear problems in structural dynamics. Various important attributes were demonstrated. In particular, it was shown that the scheme remains stable, without the use of adjustable parameters, when the commonly used trapezoidal rule results in unstable solutions. In this paper we focus on additional important attributes of the scheme, and specifically on showing that the procedure can also be effective in linear analyses. We give, in comparison to other methods, the spectral radius, period elongation, and amplitude decay of the scheme and study the solution of a simple ‘model problem’ with a very flexible and stiff response."

abstract = "Transient analysis of nonlinear problems in structural and solid mechanics is mainly carried out using direct time integration of the equations of motion. For reliable solutions, a stable and efficient integration algorithm is desirable. Methods that are unconditionally stable in linear analyses appear to be a natural choice for use in nonlinear analyses, but unfortunately may not remain stable for a given time step size in large deformation and long time range response solutions. A composite time integration scheme is proposed and tested in some example solutions against the trapezoidal rule and the Wilson θ-method, and found to be effective where the trapezoidal rule fails to produce a stable solution. These example results are indicative of the merits of the composite scheme."
